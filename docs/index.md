  Terraform provider for the todo-list-server
---

# todo Provider

This provider is designed to be used with the `todo-list-server`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/spkane/todo-for-terraform/releases).

It is primarily for teaching the fundamentals of how Terraform and its providers function, by stripping away the complexity of interacting with cloud services.

## Example Usage

**NOTE:** This `todo-list-server` is not secure and should not be used for anything real.

```terraform
provider "todo" {
  host = "127.0.0.1"
  port = "8080"
  apipath = "/"
  schema = "http"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `apipath` (String) The URL path for the todo server API
- `host` (String) The FQDN or IP address for the todo server
- `port` (String) The port for the todo server
- `schema` (String) The URL schema for the todo server
